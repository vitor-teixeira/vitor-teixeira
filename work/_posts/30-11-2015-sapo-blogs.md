description: When you publish a post on SAPO Blogs you are sharing your thoughts, ideas and opinions with the largest Portuguese community of authors and blog readers.
---
SAPO Blogs is a free and open service to all seeking a platform to share their ideas, opinions and stories. In 2014 it was the turn of the publishing interface of SAPO Blogs to be reformed. We focused on improving the experience of people who publish, so it was with those users that we gathered the key requirements, tested and improved iterations of the interface. From the graphic presentation, through the organization of all the information, including the posts editor, everything was reviewed and validated.

## Main Tasks
- Requirements gathering in interviews and community feedback
- Wireframes, mockups and prototypes development and validation
- Information Architecture
- Design overview and responsive best practices
- User testing
- Heuristic evaluation
- Quality Assurance
- Performance analysis

## The result
Check out [SAPO BLOGS][blogs]{:target="_blank"} and enjoy your reading.
