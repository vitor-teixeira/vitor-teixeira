In 2013 we decided to revamp the platform experience, and ever since we have been making some impactful changes both for users and business alike. With most of the videos watched outside the SAPO V&Iacute;deos Website, via embeds and other websites in SAPO's network, we decided to give special attention to the logged experience, since we wanted our users to be able to upload and manage their video libraries in the easiest way possible. It's now also possible to use the website with any modern device, both for watching or managing videos.
